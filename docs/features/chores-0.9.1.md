# 0.9.1 chores

**Status:** Next release | **Date:** 2026-10-08 | **Builds on:** release 0.9 (`this-pr/release-0.9.0.md` § Prisma bundle)

One migration carries both chores: `make d1-create-migration name=chores-0-9-1`, the rewrites below in the Prisma
source, then `rm migrations/NNNN_*.sql && make d1-flatten-migrations`. `make d1-verify-<env>` runs before and after
the apply on local (a copy of dev), dev and prod; `tests/component/architecture/migrations.unit.spec.ts` keeps the
file free of `DROP TABLE`.

## Drop `DinnerEvent.totalCost`

### Problem

Release 0.9 moves a dinner's grocery cost into `Expense` rows and computes `totalCost` from them. The column stays
in the schema, marked `/// @deprecated`, so the 0.9 migration is additive and the code running during the migration
keeps working.

### Solution

Prisma emits a table rebuild for the drop and `DinnerEvent` has children (`Order`, `DinnerDuty`, `TicketWaitlist`,
`DinnerEventAllergen`, `Expense`) whose cascades a rebuild's `DROP TABLE` fires on D1; the block is rewritten in the
Prisma source to `ALTER TABLE "DinnerEvent" DROP COLUMN "totalCost"` (SQLite ≥ 3.35; plain, unindexed column). The
field and its `@deprecated` tag leave the schema; the generated client no longer carries it.

### Preconditions

- Every environment runs the release in which `totalCost` is computed from `Expense` rows and no code writes the
  column (`npm run ts` fails on any remaining writer once the field is gone).
- The 0.9 migration's mapping of existing `totalCost` values to `Expense` rows has run on local, dev and prod.

### TDD

- `make d1-verify-<env>`: child-without-parent counts unchanged after the apply.
- Existing suites green with the field removed from the dinner schemas and fixtures.

### Affected

`prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/generated/*`, `migrations/`, the dinner schemas and fixtures that still name
`totalCost`, `docs/adr-compliance-backend.md` (dinner-event rows).

## Order snapshot (B6)

### Problem

Kitchen statistics count 0 portions for an order whose `ticketPriceId` is null: `ticketType` is read through the
`ticketPrice` relation, and the relation is gone once a ticket price row is deleted (`onDelete: SetNull`). Every
affected order sits CLOSED on a past dinner and matches exactly one ticket price by season and `priceAtBooking`
(checked 2026-10-08).

### Solution

1. `ticketType` joins `OrderSnapshotSchema`; the first round of the package settles the backfill shape — the schema
   has ten required fields, two of them formatted in TypeScript (`inhabitantNameWithInitials`, `householdShortname`),
   so the backfill is either a slimmer snapshot with optional provenance fields or a TypeScript job.
2. `Order.orderSnapshot String?` — `ALTER TABLE "Order" ADD COLUMN "orderSnapshot" TEXT`, taken as Prisma emits it.
3. Order creation (`financesRepository.ts`, `scaffoldPrebookings.ts`) captures the snapshot with `ticketType` from
   the ticket price, as `Transaction.orderSnapshot` does.
4. Portion calculation (`useOrder.ts`) reads `ticketType` from the relation, then from the snapshot.
5. Backfill, convergent: orders with `ticketPriceId` null and no snapshot get the `ticketType` of the season's ticket
   price whose `price` equals `priceAtBooking`.

### TDD

- Unit: portion calculation with the relation null and a snapshot present; the snapshot captured on create carries
  `ticketType`.
- E2E: kitchen statistics on a dinner whose ticket price row is deleted after booking.

### Affected

`KitchenPreparation.vue`, `useOrder.ts`, `useBookingValidation.ts`, `financesRepository.ts`,
`scaffoldPrebookings.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/generated/*`, `migrations/`,
`docs/adr-compliance-backend.md` (order rows).
